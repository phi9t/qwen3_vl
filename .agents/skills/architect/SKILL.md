# Architect

Design before implementing. Sketch types, function signatures, class shapes, and module boundaries with `not implemented` bodies and pseudocode. Synthesize across independent review points, then fill in code against the chosen sketch. If implementation proves the sketch wrong, throw it out and redesign.

## Start

Open a todolist with one entry per phase before starting work. Autonomous mode without checkpoints needs the list to show phase position and keep phases from silently disappearing.

1. Ground
2. Sketch
3. Agree
4. Implement
5. Scrap

## Phase A: Ground the problem

Build a real mental model of every system the new code touches. Run the **how** skill over the relevant subsystems. If architecture may constrain the design, run how in Critique mode.

Naming a file isn't grounding. Produce the traced model `how` prescribes. If the design will redefine ownership or layering, also run the **why** skill so rationale becomes a constraint, not a guess.

Skip Phase A only when the work is genuinely greenfield with no surrounding system to integrate.

## Phase B: Sketch

Run the **arena** skill with the design-sketch task and the Phase A grounding artifacts as input. Pass `references/runner-prompt.md` as each runner's prompt. Each runner produces:

- type sketch
- function signatures
- module map
- design rationale

The output should be in the shape of `references/rationale-template.md`.

Use multi-agent exploration only when it materially improves independent design coverage. If unavailable, compare 2-3 in-person sketches yourself and record tradeoffs before proceeding.

## Phase C: Agree (opt-in)

Default: proceed directly to implementation with the synthesized design. No human checkpoint.

Opt in to a checkpoint when the invoker explicitly asks: "/architect with checkpoint," "stop and show me before implementing," or similar. When opted in, surface the synthesized design and pause for sign-off before continuing.

If the human pushes back on the shape (in a checkpoint or after the fact), treat that as Phase A evidence. Re-ground and re-run Phase B before writing more code.

## Phase D: Implement against the sketch

Replace `not implemented` bodies with code, pseudocode with logic. The synthesized sketch is the contract.

Deviations from the sketch are signal worth surfacing, not friction to absorb silently. If a function needs a parameter the sketch didn't anticipate, ask whether the sketch was wrong, the requirement was missed, or the implementation is overreaching. Surface it; don't bolt it on.

## Phase E: Scrap when the architecture is wrong

If implementation keeps producing friction the sketch can't absorb, throw the sketch out. Don't bolt fixes onto a wrong design, per the **redesign-from-first-principles** principle skill and the **fix-root-causes** principle skill.

The signal is a *pattern*, not single instances. Tells:

- The same shape of workaround appearing repeatedly across unrelated code.
- Multiple unrelated edge cases that all need special-case branches.
- Types that need escape hatches (`any`, casts, optional fields that are always set in practice) to compile.
- Callers having to know the abstraction's internal rules to use it.
- Two or more independent Phase D deviations of the same shape across the implementation.

Use judgment. A few edge cases don't condemn an architecture. Some problems are legitimately complex, and complexity in the data is not the same as complexity in the design. The rewrite signal is repeated friction of the same shape, not single hard cases.

When you do scrap:

1. Re-run the **how** skill over what's been built. The implementation lessons enter the new design as inputs, not vibes.
2. Redesign as if the new constraints had been day-one assumptions, per redesign-from-first-principles.
3. Subtract before adding, per the **subtract-before-you-add** principle skill. The new sketch should be smaller than the old one before it grows.
4. Return to Phase B and re-run arena.

## Outputs

One file with new types and signatures for small changes; the module map plus type definitions for larger work. The rationale ships alongside, shaped per `references/rationale-template.md`, including the synthesis decision.

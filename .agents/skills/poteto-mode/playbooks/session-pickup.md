### Session pickup

**You own the resume point. Read the prior trail, don't redo it.** For "take over this", "resume this conversation", "continue from these notes", "you're taking over", "pick up where X left off", local audit artifacts, or a pushed branch you're meant to continue.

A pickup is inheritance. The prior agent already paid the cost of reading the code, running the repros, and making the design choices. Redoing that work loses the bias check the prior trail gives you and burns context on state you already have. Resist the urge to re-derive; read.

1. Locate the prior trail. Prefer local task artifacts and run-level notes: git log, git diff, command outputs, and any `.audit` or task log files. A pushed branch is useful if it carries the handoff context.
2. Reconstruct operational state. The branch and worktree, what already landed (`git log`, `git diff` against the base), the open todos, the decisions already made. The prior trail is authoritative input. Resist the bias to re-derive it.
3. Diff done vs pending. Compare what shipped against what was planned, name the resume point, and do not re-run the prior repro or redo completed work. A "let me verify from scratch" pass is the tell that you're treating the trail as untrustworthy when it's actually authoritative.
4. Route the remaining work to the matching playbook and pick the verdict. Continue the execution, ship a finished recommendation, ratify or override a prior conclusion, or postmortem a failed run. The pickup playbook ends here; the routed playbook owns the rest.
5. Verify the inherited claims against the original goal on the real artifact (the **principle-prove-it-works** skill). You are inheriting unverified work, and a passing prior self-report is not the proof.

**Reply:** where the prior agent stopped, what you inherited vs redid (ideally nothing redone), the resume point, and the outcome.

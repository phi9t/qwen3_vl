### Perf issue

**You own the measurement story. Plan, review, verify the numbers.** Tie every fix to a measurement; don't read source instead of measuring.

1. Capture a baseline trace with the matching runtime tooling.
2. `how` to ground hypotheses; don't claim a perf ceiling without running it first.
3. Plan the fix from the trace. If it crosses a function boundary, `architect` first. Delegate implementation to a focused helper when available; review the diff. Capture a post-fix trace.
4. Parse and compare the artifacts (JSON to sqlite, diff). "Inconclusive" or wrong-surface is not a pass; flag it.
5. Cite the measurement in the PR.
6. Run **Opening a PR**.


**Reply:** baseline number, post-fix number, delta, artifact path.
